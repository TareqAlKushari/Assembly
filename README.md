# Assembly

Welcome to the **Assembly** repository!

This repository contains assembly language projects and experiments by [@TareqAlKushari](https://github.com/TareqAlKushari).

## About

This repository serves as a collection of programs, exercises, and code snippets written in Assembly language.  
It is designed for learning, experimentation, and demonstrating low-level programming concepts.

## Features

- Assembly language source code
- Example programs and exercises
- Experiments with low-level hardware and processor instructions

## Getting Started

To get started with the code in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TareqAlKushari/Assembly.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Assembly
   ```
3. **Build and run the code:**
   - Follow the instructions in code comments for assembling and running specific programs.
   - Typically, you can use an assembler (like `nasm` or `masm`) and an emulator or your systemâ€™s native execution environment.

   Example for NASM on Linux:
   ```bash
   nasm -f elf64 program.asm -o program.o
   ld program.o -o program
   ./program
   ```

   *(Replace `program.asm` with the actual file name.)*
